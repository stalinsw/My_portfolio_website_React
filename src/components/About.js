      <br></br>
      <p className='about-me'>Hello! I'm Stalin Shone Wilson, a B.Tech graduate with a CGPA of 8.72 from APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University, passionate about QA and Front-end Development.
I have a solid understanding of Manual Testing, Automation (Selenium, Core Java, TestNG, Maven), and front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Bootstrap), with a focus on creating dynamic, user-friendly interfaces. Driven by curiosity and continuous learning, I'm expanding my skills in backend development (Python, Django) and exploring Full Stack Development. I'm always open to discussing quality assurance and UI development opportunities.
Let's connect!</p>
